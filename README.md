## üî• The Problem

Say your `Pipfile` is configured to pull packages from a private Amazon Web Services CodeArtifact repository:

```text
[[source]]
name = "private"
url = "https://aws:$CODEARTIFACT_AUTH_TOKEN@corp-012345678901.d.codeartifact.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pypi/pypi-mirror/simple/"
verify_ssl = true

[packages]
tupper = "*"

[requires]
python = "3.9"
```

Your `Pipfile` expects the `CODEARTIFACT_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable to be set to your authorisation token.

`wev-awscodeartifact` extends [wev](https://github.com/cariad/wev) to handle your CodeArtifact authorisation token for you.

## üéÅ Installation

`wev-awscodeartifact` requires Python 3.8 or later and [wev](https://github.com/cariad/wev).

`wev` and `wev` plugins are usually happy to run within virtual environments, but that's tricky if your project's `Pipfile` has _only_ private sources that require a token. `wev-awscodeartifact` cannot generate a token before it's installed.

I recommend installing `wev` and `wev-awscodeartifact` globally, _outside_ of your virtual environment.

```bash
python -m pip install wev
python -m pip install wev-awscodeartifact
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Filename and location

See [wevcli.app/configuration](https://wevcli.app/configuration) for a detailed guide to `wev` configuration files.

If in doubt, create your configuration file as `wev.yml` in your project directory.

### Properties

| Property | Required | Description                                 | Default                  |
|----------|----------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| account  |          | AWS account ID                              | _Your profile's account_ |
| domain   | ‚úîÔ∏è        | CodeArtifact domain name<sup>1</sup>        |                          |
| profile  |          | AWS named profile to use for authentication | _Your default profile_   |
| region   |          | AWS region hosting the CodeArtifact domain  | _Your profile's region_  |

<sup>1</sup> The CodeArtifact domain is _not_ the same as the repository's domain name. Given the domain name `corp-000000000000.d.codeartifact.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`, the CodeArtifact domain is `corp`.

### Examples

#### Minimal configuration

```yaml
CODEARTIFACT_AUTH_TOKEN:
  plugin:
    id: wev-awscodeartifact
    domain: corp
```

#### Team + personal configuration

You probably don't want to add the `profile` property to `.wev.yml` if you plan to commit and share it with your team mates. Profile names are personal, and you don't want to force everyone to use the same as you.

If you _do_ need to set `profile`, I suggest you create it in `.wev.user.yml` (which should not be shared) and let `wev` merge it in.

For example:

```yaml
# .wev.yml
CODEARTIFACT_AUTH_TOKEN:
  plugin:
    id: wev-awscodeartifact
    account: "012345678901"
    domain: corp
    region: eu-west-1
```

```yaml
# .wev.user.yml
CODEARTIFACT_AUTH_TOKEN:
  plugin:
    profile: work
```

## üíª Usage

Run `wev` with any command that requires a CodeArtifact authorisation token.

For example, to run `pipenv install` with a CodeArtifact authorisation token:

```bash
wev pipenv install
```

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è FAQs

### Can I change the environment variable from CODEARTIFACT_AUTH_TOKEN?

Yes! Call it anything you like.

### Does wev-awscodeartifact work with other package managers?

Yes! `wev-awscodeartifact` will work with _any_ command line tool that needs CodeArtifact authorisation tokens in environment variables.

My name is **Cariad**, and I'm an [independent freelance DevOps engineer](https://cariad.me).

I'd love to spend more time working on projects like this, but--as a freelancer--my income is sporadic and I need to chase gigs that pay the rent.

If this project has value to you, please consider [‚òïÔ∏è sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/cariad) me. Sponsorships grant me time to work on _your_ wants rather than _someone else's_.

Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
